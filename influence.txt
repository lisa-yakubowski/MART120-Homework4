The person who influenced me the most was my Godmother Margret Linson, she had an incredible work ethic. She was an intensive care nurse and treated every patient and family with the outmost dignity and kindness. She loved her work and only stopped working in her 70s after a debilitating stroke. 

Throughout her life she never stopped learning. She had three Masters degrees, and even with earning that she still continued educating herself. She was a true academic. Watching her perseverance is what motivated me, at age 50, to earn my degree and let me see that I can go on to earn a Masters degree, even at my age. 

I lost my beloved Godmother a few years back, the pain of never talking to her saddens me, I still have her final birthday wishes in my voicemail. I listen to it every so often and know how much love we shared with the time we had.
